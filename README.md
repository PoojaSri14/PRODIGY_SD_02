# 📈 Task 2 – Line Chart (Prodigy Infotech Internship)

This project is part of my **Data Science Internship at Prodigy Infotech**. In this task, I created a **Line Chart** using Python without relying on any CSV file. All data is manually defined within the script and visualized using `matplotlib`.

---

## ✅ Objective

To visualize continuous data trends over time using a **line chart**. This task builds understanding in plotting continuous variables and customizing line charts for clarity and aesthetics.
